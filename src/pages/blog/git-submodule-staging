So, when working with git submodules, it turns out that if you try to update a git submodule from its parent repository
when changes in child submodules have been staged but not yet committed, that the update of the child submodule is a no-op
and the child will not be updated as desired!

Command in question:
```bash
git submodule update --recursive
```

Expected:
When I run the above command, it actually points to the commit of the submodule that my parent git repository is pointing to.

Actual:
If the submodule changes have been staged but not yet committed in the parent repository, then the command does not make any changes!

Solution:

(From the parent repository)
```bash
git reset HEAD .
```
or
```bash
git reset HEAD name-of-the-submodule
```

Then the command above works!
